## Functionality:

	On the backend, the app uses express to serve routes and mongoose to interact with a MongoDB database.

	On the frontend, the app uses ReactJS for rendering components, axios for internal/external API calls, and bootstrap as a styling framework.

	In order to transpile the JSX code, webpack and babel were utilized. All of the JSX code in the /app folder was transpiled into the bundle.js file located in the /public folder.

## To run this app on your local machine:

	Clone the repo

    Ensure that you have MongoDB set up on your laptop

    Once you are set up, cd into this repo and run 'npm install' and then run the script 'node server'.
    Then open another git bash or terminal window and run mongod.
    Open up a third git bash or terminal window and run 'webpack -w'.
    Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
